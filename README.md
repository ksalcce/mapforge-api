The MapForge app is a map generator for tabletop role-playing games that allows the user to quickly generate maps with different terrains represented by different colored tiles. The user can then save these maps for later use if they create an account

This app is powered in the front-end by React & React Router, and in the back-end by NodeJS, Express, PostgresQL, & Knex.js
